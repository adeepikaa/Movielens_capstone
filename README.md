# Movie recommendation system using Movielens Dataset

Data Science Professional Certificate by HardvardX Capstone project 

Recommendation systems use ratings that users give the products to make particular recommendations. When users buy products from different companies like Amazon, Walmart, Target etc., they are allowed to rate the different products they have purchased. The companies are then able to collect massive datasets that can be used to predict which rating a specific user will give to a specific product. Products for which a high rating is predicted for a given user are then recommended to that user.

The goal of this project is to create a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset by utilizing all the skills that were taught throughout the courses in the Data Science Certificate Program by HarvardX.
